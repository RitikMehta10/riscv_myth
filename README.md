## 🎛️ 🎶 Understanding the Multiplexer (MUX)

## 🔍 What is a Multiplexer?

A **Multiplexer** (or **MUX**) is a **combinational circuit** that selects one of several inputs and sends it to the output.  
Think of it like a **digital switch** controlled by select lines.

## 🛠️ 2-to-1 Multiplexer (Basic Example)

### 🔌 Inputs:
- `x1`, `x2`: Two input signals (1-bit each)  
- `s`: Select signal (1 bit)

### 📤 Output:
- `f`: The selected output, based on `s`

### 🧮 Boolean Expression:
If `s = 0`, then `f = x2`  
If `s = 1`, then `f = x1`
